Dodo operates on a set of backdrops, that must be configured in configuration
files (in the current directory or one of the config directories). Backdrops
are similar to docker-composes services, but they define one-shot commands
instead of long-running services. More specifically, each backdrop defines a 
docker container in which a script should be executed. Dodo simply passes all 
CMD arguments to the first backdrop with NAME that is found. Additional FLAGS
can be used to overwrite the backdrop configuration.
